                <p style="margin:50px;font-size:x-large">In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk,
                     supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may
                      be narrower, including only wood plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber 
                      or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, 
                      and bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species 
                      that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete 
                      for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. Trees have been 
                      in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are some three trillion mature trees in the world.

                <p style="margin:50px;font-size:x-large">A commonly applied narrower definition is that a tree has a woody trunk formed by
                     secondary growth,meaning that the trunk thickens each year by growing outwards, in addition to the primary upwards growth 
                     from the growing tip.[5][8] Under such a definition, herbaceous plants such as palms, bananas and papayas are not 
                     considered trees regardless of their height, growth form or stem girth. Certain monocots may be considered trees 
                     under a slightly looser definition;[9] while the Joshua tree, bamboos and palms do not have secondary growth and
                      never produce true wood with growth rings,[10][11] they may produce "pseudo-wood" by lignifying cells formed by
                       primary growth.[12] Tree species in the genus Dracaena, despite also being monocots, do have secondary growth 
                       caused by meristem in their trunk, but it is different from the thickening meristem found in dicotyledonous trees
